onedmotion
==========

onedmotion is a python module for 1D motion calculations. It contains a class  describing a 1D motion profile and allows getting the position and velocity of the system as a function of time.

Currently a motion profile is described by the following properties:

- Travel distance.
- Start position
- Acceleration and deacceleration.
- Maximum speed

What is currently missing is jerk and the more complex combined motions.

Usage
-----

See test-plot-motion.py for an example of how to use.
